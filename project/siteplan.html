    <h1>Project Site Plan</h1>

    <h2>Site name</h2>
    <p><b>TastyTrove</b></p>
    <p>The name consists of two parts: "tasty," which conveys delight and gastronomic pleasure, and "trove," which
        suggests a valuable, diverse, and hidden collection waiting to be explored. It's a name that is easy to remember
        and pronounce. It sounds professional with a fun touch, making it ideal for attracting both professional and
        casual cooks.</p>
    <p>Domain avaible: <b>tastytrove.org</b></p>

    <h2>Site purpuse</h2>
    <p>TastyTrove is an innovative website designed to revolutionize the way users search for and discover recipes. My
        goal is to provide an intuitive and accessible platform for both professional chefs and casual cooks, making it
        easy to explore a wide variety of culinary recipes.</p>
    <p>This website not only simplifies the search for recipes but also inspires users to experiment in the kitchen,
        offering personalized recommendations and highlighting the best options according to their culinary preferences.
    </p>
